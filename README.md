# drum-kit
The Drum Kit is an interactive web application that lets users play drum sounds by pressing keys on the keyboard or clicking on buttons. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project creates a fun and responsive virtual drumming experience.
Each key or button is mapped to a different drum sound like snare, kick, tom, and crash. When a key is pressed or a button is clicked, the corresponding sound plays instantly.
The UI features a clean layout with visually styled buttons that animate on interaction, giving real-time feedback. JavaScript is used to handle event listeners, audio playback, and visual effects, making it a great project for learning DOM manipulation and event handling. The application is fully responsive and works across devices. It's perfect for beginners who want to explore how to integrate audio with frontend development. Users can easily expand it by adding more sounds or customizing the design. Overall, itâ€™s a creative and fun way to learn web development basics while making music!
